            <p>LEO is orbit that is from 160km to 2000km above the surface.</p>

            <p>A lot of satellites use this orbit because it's very close, and gives a lot of flexibility of what parts of Earth you want to cover.</p>

            <p>Hubble, telecommunication satellites, ISS - they all use LEO.</p>

            <p>However not all satellites orbit LEO in a circular line on the equator.</p>

            Moving around earth at an angle (inclination) has it's benefits and reasons.

            ISS, for example, has inclination of 51.65 degrees, meaning that it travels at an 51.65 degree angle to the equator.

            Reason for that is that 51.6 degrees is the lowest inclination that rockets can be sent to from russian space station baikonur.

        <div class="frame">
            Compared to Kennedy Space Center (28.5 degree inclination), Baikonur is "higher", meaning that rockets sent from there must be sent at a bigger angle to the equator.
